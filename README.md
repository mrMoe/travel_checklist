- At least ONE set of clean underwear for each day you stay, plus two for traveling to and from congress (Doesn't necessarily need to be in matching pairs, but that is up to you.)
- At least ONE pair of clean socks/stockings/tights/overknees for each day you stay, plus two for traveling to and from congress (again, matching pairs optional)

## Gear

Label ALL your gear in a consistent manner. (Mastodon handle and DECT numbers have proven to be working well.)
In case something gets lost it can find its way back to you.

## Power and Chargers

Start charging your batteries right now so they're ready when you finish packing and leave.

For travelling abroad there is a handy [World map showing the spread of plug types][40]

- 3x to 10x multi-plug power extension (230V AC @50Hz) with [Schuko Plug][6] (and optional switch, hotel rooms usually suffer from severe lack of outlets)
- cable drum (power, ethernet, fiber)
- Chargers for all those phones, or at least matching cables if you can charge over USB.
  - most Android phones (and other exotic stuff like WP, Firefox OS, etc)
    - micro USB cable, or
        - USB-C cable (to USB A or USB-C)
    - DECT phones
        - Charging cradle (with power brick if required)
- A portable battery pack (aka powerbank) so you can charge on the go. (And the necessary cable to recharge that battery pack overnight. A USB-A to micro USB cable in most cases, maybe already a USB-C cable as well.)
- 3-phase 400V adapter to 230V single phase (ruggedized outdoor kind)
* Solarpanele
* Oktupus-Ladegerät


## Laptop and Devices

- Laptop (with a working battery)
  - Maybe clean display and keyboard while you're at it ;-)
  - Charger for laptop
- USB flash drives
  - Put an OWNER.txt file on them with information on how to contact you in case one gets lost accidentally. (Mastodon, phone (for example DECT, 33C3 GSM extensions), email, name of the assembly you're well known at, owl, raven)
  - For devices with private information be sure to encrypt them! (VeraCrypt, GPG, FileVault, EncFS, Bitlocker, gbde, geli, dm-crypt, LUKS, eCryptFS)
    - Make a GPT Label or Volume label with your online nickname or handle because people can't read your owner.txt file on encrypted devices. You may also create multiple partitions (plaintext and encrypted ones).
  - If physically possible, add an actual label (just write on it/add a tag) with your nick on it – many people will be rightfully hesitant to plug in a found USB stick.
  - make note of the filesystem used so you know if they will work on the system of the person you want to exchange data with. (FAT32 is a safe bet to work everywhere, for larger files ExFAT should also work on most platforms.)
  - USB/Thunderbolt/USB-C to Ethernet RJ45 adapter, if your device needs one (for example thin notebooks)
- Mass storage devices (bring some empty ones to fill with data and/or bring your own data and share it!)

## Wireless and HF

- SDR Equipment: HackRF, RTL-SDR, Ettus, [Rad1o badge][30]

## Cables and Adapters (Dongles)

### USB (A, B, Legacy)

Yes, there are way too many different types of USB cables, connectors and standards, double check you have them all.

- Mini USB cable
- Micro USB cable

### USB-C

Keep in mind that USB-C *only* refers to the connector, not the charging, signals and alternative modes it actually supports.
Check out the [USB-C cable matrix][36] (Caution, Google Doc, may be gone as well. The contents have been liberated and are available tracking free in the [USB-C Cable Matrix CryptPad][50]) on what a certain manufacturer's cable actually supports.

- USB-C cable (Check if it does 5Gbit/s or 10Gbit/s USB. It doesn't have to, but helps to *know* before you troubleshoot an issue for hours.)
- USB-C docking station (and power supply if necessary)

### Networking (wired and wireless)

- RJ45 Ethernet adapter (from USB-A, USB-C or Thunderbolt) to access the wired network. Thanks for not leeching on the WiFi!
- Ethernet cords (Cat5e/Cat6) of multiple lengths (bring a spare to tether a friend)

## Mobile and Communications

- Phones
  - Mobile phone (GSM) one each
    - for your day-to-day SIM card
    - for a local GSM network at the venue,
  - DECT phone (for the local wireless phone network available at many CCC events)
        - Be sure to register your extension number at [Eventphone][2] prior to the event.
        - Check if your DECT model is [compatible with Eventphone][31]
- SIM cards (your usual one, european SIM [no roaming fees inside EU], CCC SIM)
- Set your GSM network selection to **manual** or you might end up connected to a rogue GSM network.

### Pre-paid SIM Cards

Make sure you get a [right sized SIM card][11] for your GSM mobile phone!
If you need help with buying a SIM card, ask a local for assistance. They're friendly!

Since citizens from the EU can now use their dataplan while roaming within the EU, consider using that if you can. Keep in mind that you may travel through countries that are not part of the EU where you may get charged enormous amounts. You want to turn off mobile data while traveling through those countries.

These SIM cards have proven to work well if you need one. When in doubt, ask people who are local to the country of the venue. They surely can recommend a good prepaid SIM to get.

## Schedule

- Install one of the Fahrplan apps for Android ([PlayStore][26], [Source][27]) or iOS ([iTunes][28])
- Be sure to schedule a period of time to get your T-Shirt or pullover/hoodie/zipper (when preordered in the first two days)!

## 🔒 Securing your devices

All security measures for devices on public Internet networks also apply here – threats might come from untrusted devices _within_, as well as from maleficent third parties _outside_ the Congress network. Of course you should have these measures in place everywhere and all the time since event networks are no more or no less dangerous than the internet in general.

Read the [How to survive guide][1] in the Congress Wiki. There are many excellent tips in there or consult you local [CryptoParty][33] meetup, CCC ERFA or hackspace friends.

### Backups

Make fresh backups of ALL the devices you bring. Test that you can actually restore data from those backups!
Have something to backup your laptop on site as well.

### PowerOn/BIOS/EFI Password

Make sure you do have set a BIOS or EFI Password to prevent booting from a live CD to attack your system.

### Full disk encryption

Activate full disk encryption with pre-boot authentication. (Mac: Activate FileVault, FreeBSD: GELI, Linux: Cryptsetup, Windows: ~~Windows? S'SLY?~~ VeraCrypt)

Make sure your system does suspend to disk (SSD) and not to RAM, so you can't extract the passphrase from RAM via Firewire/Thunderbolt/ColdBoot attack.

### Servers

Check that _all_ your server services are using proper TLS. See [bettercrypto.org][15] or other sources you trust for help on how to properly configure your servers. (Mail, Web, VPN, SSH, etc.)

### VPN tunnel

Have at least one trusted, working and tested VPN endpoint available for tunneling out of the congress network. If you don't have your own VPN server at your disposal, ask friends you trust to help you out. If you do, ask your friends if they need a VPN endpoint and share!

- [WireGuard][146]
- [OpenVPN][16]
- L2TP/IPSec/IKEv2
- [SSH][18]
- [SSHuttle][9]
- [iodine][17] (DNS tunnel for those pesky for-pay captive portal WiFi networks)
- [Tor/Vidalia][19]

Don't use PPTP, IKEv1, PSK VPNs anymore, they're known to be insecure.
Make sure your VPN works with IP and Legacy IP without leaking DNS and other traffic.

Also have those tunnels configured on ALL the devices you intend to use on the local network of the venue, and have it tested. That includes your laptops, phones, tablets, servers, fridge, etc.

### Wifi connection

It is not recommended to connect to the wifi -- if you still can't resist, here are a few things to consider:

- WIFI connections are identified by their SSID. Some operating systems automatically reconnect to known WIFI networks by default. Make sure that your OS is not configured to automatically connect to any networks automatically (for example "OEBB" or "Wifi-on-ICE" for Austrian and German public transport networks respectively), otherwise your device might be tricked into connecting to a malicious network.
- Make sure that it's **not a 802.11b** device, as it would slow down the complete wifi network.
- Disable all synchronization services, as they might be using plaintext.
- Disable all auto-discovery services (network music players, remote control apps, etc …).
- Make sure there are no known exploits for your device (not that unknown-to-you exploits wouldn't be a possible risk as well…).
- Turn off push notifications.
- Update your apps, especially your browser.
- Use a VPN tunnel if possible.
- Use a Firewall and only allow the (few) services you trust.
  - [DroidWall][22] for Android (root required)
- If you don't have a VPN tunnel available, you can use [OnionBrowser][7] (iOS) or [Orbot][orbot] (Android) to surf via Tor (which may be its own kind of risk).

**If you are unsure** if there are still some services transmitting plaintext data, **do not connect**.

## 📫 Staying up-to-date

Most events publish a lot of information about events as they happen. There are many ways to stay in the loop during the event or in between by subscribing to RSS feeds, Twitter accounts, Mastodon accounts, mailing lists and even newsletters [sic].
For a list of CCC related news sources you may be interested in following, see 'CCCongress Info Channels.md' in this repository.

## 🔙 For when you return home

- Store chocolate/chips/crisps at home as an post-event depression antidote
- Make notes during the event to watch all the lectures you missed on site because you were attending an awesome workshop or were having interesting conversations with people.
- Contact the cool people you met at the event
- Look for related local events and communities
